The word galaxy is derived from the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally "milky", a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few hundred million (10^8) stars to giants with one hundred trillion (10^14) stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass.</p>

<p style="color:white">Before the 20th century, we didn't know that galaxies other than the Milky Way existed; earlier astronomers had classified them as
 as “nebulae,” since they looked like fuzzy clouds. But in the 1920s, astronomer Edwin Hubble showed that the Andromeda “nebula”
 was a galaxy in its own right. Since it is so far from us, it takes light from Andromeda more than 2.5 million years to bridge
  the gap. Despite the immense distance, Andromeda is the closest large galaxy to our Milky Way, and it's bright enough in the
  night sky that it's visible to the naked eye in the Northern Hemisphere.

In 1936, Hubble debuted a way to classify galaxies, grouping them into four main types: spiral galaxies, lenticular galaxies,
 elliptical galaxies, and irregular galaxies.</p>

       <p style="font-size:18px" > More than two-thirds of all observed galaxies are spiral galaxies. They have a flat, spinning disk with a central bulge surrounded by spiral arms. The spinning motion reaches speeds of up to hundreds of kilometers/miles per second. This usually can cause matter in the disk to take on a distinctive spiral shape, like a cosmic pinwheel. The bulge located in the center is made up of older, dimmer stars, and is thought to usually contain a supermassive black hole.


The disk of stars orbiting the bulge tends to separate into arms that circle the galaxy. These spiral arms contain a wealth of gas and dust, thus many young stars are birthed in these regions. These young stars shine very brightly before their quick demise. Spiral galaxies can be classified according to the tightness of their spiral, the lumpiness of their arms, and the overall size of their central bulge.

The relative amounts of gas and dust contained within these galaxies can portray these differences. Andromeda is a perfect example of a spiral galaxy.</p1>

       <p style="font-size:18px"> Barred spiral galaxies share the same features and functions as regular spiral galaxies, but they also have a bar of bright
        stars that lie along the center of the bulge and extend into the disk. The bright bulge has very little activity here and
        contains mostly older, red stars. The bar and arms have lots of activity, including star formation.  About one third of all spiral galaxies are barred spiral in shape.
        The perfect example of a barred spiral galaxy is our own galaxy, the Milky Way. They are further divided into three categories:
<ol style="font-size:14px">
  <li>  Barred spiral galaxy type A – abbreviation SBa – they feature tightly bound arms.</li>
  <li>  Barred spiral galaxy type B – abbreviation SBb – they feature both tightly and loosely bond arms.</li>
  <li>  Barred spiral galaxy type C – abbreviation Sbc – they have loosely bound arms.</li>

     Elliptical galaxies have an elongated spherical shape and lack a nucleus or bulge at the center. Although there is no nucleus, the galaxy is still brighter in the center and becomes less bright toward the outer edges of the galaxy.


     Their light is dominated by older reddish stars. They appear to also lack spiral arms. The stars, gases and other materials are spread throughout an elliptical galaxy. Elliptical galaxies can be nearly round or long and cigar-shaped.

     Though individual stars orbit the center of an elliptical galaxy, the orbits aren’t all in the same direction, as they appear in spirals. Therefore, ellipticals don’t appear to rotate in a systematic way

     Theories suggest that a great deal of the mass in an elliptical galaxy is due to the presence of a central black hole. Elliptical galaxies have very little activity and contain mostly old stars of low mass, because there gasses and dust which is needed to form new stars, is quite lacking.


     Elliptical galaxies vary in size, from small dwarf galaxies to enormous galaxies. An example of a giant elliptical galaxy is ESO 325-G004, while Leo I is a dwarf elliptical galaxy. An intermediate between the giant and dwarf elliptical galaxies are systems such as M32 and M110, they are companions of the Andromeda Galaxy.</p>

       <p style="font-size:18px"> A fourth type of galaxy is known as the irregular galaxy. Irregular galaxies have no definite shape, though they are in constant motion like all other galaxies. They have a chaotic appearance as they don’t seem to possess a nuclear bulge or traces of spiral arms.


       Some irregular galaxies were once spiral or elliptical galaxies but were deformed by an uneven external gravitational force. Irregular galaxies may contain abundant amounts of gas and dust Irregular galaxies are commonly small, about one-tenth the mass of the Milky Way galaxy.

       Until now, three major types of irregular galaxies have been established:</p>
<ol style="font-size:14px">
  <li>Irr I – they feature some structure but not enough to be placed into the Hubble sequence.</li>
  <li>IIrr II – they do not appear to feature any structure.</li>
  <li>DIrr III – dwarf irregular galaxy. They tend to have low metallicity and relatively high levels of gas. They are also believed to be similar to the earliest galaxies that populated the Universe.
  </li>
</ol>
       <p style="font-size:18px"> Irregular galaxies can be distorted by the gravity of a larger neighbor, a good example of this are the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, distorted by our Milky Way.

       Some galaxies have a ring-like structure of stars and interstellar medium surrounding a bare core. It is believed that they take this shape when smaller galaxies pass through the core of spiral galaxies.


       Lenticular galaxies are a type of galaxy that shares similarities with both spiral and elliptical galaxies. They possess ill-defined spiral arms with an elliptical halo of stars.

       Some galaxies are classified as ultra-diffuse galaxies – they have extremely low densities. They may be as big as our Milky Way yet the visible star count typically is around 1%. This is attributed to a lack of star-forming gas.

       On the other end, there are starburst galaxies that are characterized by dusty concentrations of gas and the appearance of newly formed stars. Usually, many of these stars are massive and result in supernova explosions that interact powerfully with the surrounding gas.


       There are many other type of galaxies that exist or are discovered as you read this. With the advancement of technology, more and more distant or dim structures like galaxies can be observed and studied leading to an ever-growing classification.</p>

<h2 id=" Galactic Research">   Galactic Research</h2>

<p style="color:white">Edwin Hubble was the first person to figure out how to tell the distance of a galaxy. He used a type of pulsating star known as a Cepheid variable as a kind of galactic yardstick. Hubble noticed a correlation between the period required to complete one pulsation brightness and the amount of energy the star gives off. This was the first major breakthrough in galactic research. Hubble also discovered that there was a correlation between the red shift of a galaxy and its distance. This is known today as the Hubble constant. Today astronomers are able to measure the speed and distance of a galaxy by measuring the amount of redshift in its spectrum. We know that all galaxies are moving away from each other. The farther a galaxy is from us, the faster it is moving. To visualize this idea, imagine yourself driving on a highway at 50 miles an hour. The car in front of you is moving away from you at 50 miles an hour, which means that it is traveling at 100 miles an hour. Another car in front of the first car is moving away from it at 50 miles an hour. Though all three cars are moving away from each other at 50 miles per hour, the front car is actually moving away from you at 100 miles per hour. Since redshift shows the speed at which a galaxy is moving away from us, the greater the redshift, the faster the galaxy is moving and the farther it is from us. We now have new tools that are helping astronomers in their search for new galaxies. The Hubble space telescope has opened our eyes to sights never before seen by human eyes. The extreme clarity of Hubble allows astronomers to see fine details in nearby galaxies and to detect distant galaxies that were previously unknown. New tools currently under development will help us obtain a better understanding of the overall structure of the universe.
